# Security Analytic Cyber-Attack Visualization
Security Analytic (SA) Cyber-Attack Visualization was created as a prototype project for the RSA Security Analytic tool to provide users an alternative view to perform cyber-attack investigations for easier attack interpretations and analyzation, where multiple rows of complex data are turned into appealing visuals through the use of a 3D geogrpahical data visualization.

## Technologies Used
The prototype utilizes [Cesium](https://www.cesium.org) for the creation of the visualization envrionment and functions as well as [Bing Maps](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/) for the basemap.
