# SA-Visual
Security Analytic (SA) Cyber-Attack Visualization is a prototype project created for the RSA Security Analytic security tool to provide an alternative view for users to perform cyber-attack investigations.

The prototype was created using an open-source JavaScript library, [Cesium](https://www.cesium.org), as well as [Bing Maps](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/) as its basemap provider. 

In order for the prototype visualization to function properly, you will need to have a <b>web server</b> enabled.
