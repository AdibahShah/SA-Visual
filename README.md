# Security Analytic Cyber-Attack Visualization
Security Analytic (SA) Cyber-Attack Visualization was created as a prototype project for the RSA Security Analytic tool to provide users an <b>alternative view</b> to perform cyber-attack investigations for easier attack interpretations and analyzation, turning multiple rows of complex data into appealing visuals through the use of a <b>3D geogrpahical data visualization</b>.

The prototype is being served by an Apache Web Server that is installed in a Centos 6.5 Virtual Machine.
